	<li>Where you have made a purchase with Playwell Martial Arts during this period, we will continue to communicate with you in the same way until you tell us otherwise. If you do nothing, we will assume that you are happy for Playwell Martial Arts to continue to send you marketing communications in the same way.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
